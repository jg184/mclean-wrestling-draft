      "In his fourth year wrestling on a stacked Varsity lineup, the former Conference Champion and 4 year starter becomes the member of the \"Century Club\" with 100 varsity victories. We are proud of the former Lions Wrestler, now team Captain. He followed up the celebration with an encouraging speech for his (all underclassmen) teammates. Congratulations to Calvin and the Zug Family all in Ashburn for the event with the chance of it happening today. Cal didn't disappoint as he finished the match in Tech/Pin fashion! The team was hyped!",
